# PasswordGenerator
Password generator full stack web application using React and SpringBoot REST api. 
NOTE:
-This was a test project to learn coding skills with ReactJS, working with APis, simple database table structure, and creating a JSX UI. Java backend is not the most efficient way to make a simple password generator as API's already exist for this purpose, but I wanted to understand the process of mapping my own api and connecting the code with a different language.
